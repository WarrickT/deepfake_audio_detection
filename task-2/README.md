The paper addresses the growing concern over audio deepfakes by providing a detailed analysis of six state-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) models, offering an important starting point for future research in audio deepfake detection. The authors begin by reviewing traditional signal processing methods and common feature representations for audio data, as well as the landscape of TTS technologies. To better understand the underlying differences between various models, the authors introduced a novel dataset consisting of audio samples generated by six advanced architectures: MelGAN, FB-MelGAN, MB-MelGAN, PWG, VITS, and Parallel WaveGAN, across two languages, English and Japanese. The dataset provides a unique opportunity to analyze generated audio from different perspectives and serves as a valuable resource for researchers in the field.

A central observation from the analysis was the subtle yet important differences in the frequency spectrum of the generated audio, especially in the higher frequency ranges. By plotting the frequency spectrum of each model's output, the authors identified unique characteristics that distinguish the generated speech. They also conducted a prosody analysis to evaluate the energy distribution across different frequencies. This analysis confirmed that, while each model approximates the training data closely, differences remain in how they represent various aspects of the audio signal, particularly at higher frequencies. These findings suggest that detecting audio deepfakes might require sophisticated models that can account for such subtle discrepancies.

The paper also explores the performance of baseline classifiers trained on the new dataset. The authors used both Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and neural networks for detection and compared their effectiveness across the different datasets and settings. The results showed that while neural networks generally performed better in terms of overall accuracy, GMM classifiers exhibited greater robustness, particularly when tested in real-world settings. This finding is critical, as GMMs may be better suited to handle the unpredictable and noisy nature of real-world audio, where the quality and consistency of the generated speech might vary. Furthermore, the authors emphasized that the evaluation of classifiers should include their ability to handle adversarial examples and various perturbations, such as background noise or distortions from recording devices.

Finally, the paper introduced an attribution method to examine how the classifiers use different frequency features to make decisions. The results from this analysis highlighted the importance of both low and high-frequency information in detecting deepfakes. For example, MelGAN and FB-MelGAN relied heavily on lower frequencies for detection, while PWG, VITS, and Parallel WaveGAN utilized high-frequency features to a much greater extent. This emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to deepfake detection that considers how classifiers weigh both frequency ranges in their decision-making processes.

One major challenge identified is the difficulty in obtaining realistic malicious data for training and testing models. As the authors point out, while benign data is readily available, it is much harder to come by high-quality, real-world malicious data, which is essential for testing the true robustness of detection models. This scarcity means that much of the evaluation in this field is currently conducted using proxy datasets, which may not fully capture the variety and complexities found in real-world deepfake attacks. The authors also recognize the limitations of their chosen dataset, the LJSPEECH corpus, which contains recordings from a single speaker. Although they did compare it with other datasets like JSUT and TTS, a broader analysis that incorporates a wider variety of speakers and acoustic scenarios would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the detection challenges posed by audio deepfakes. The paper calls for future work to focus on gathering more diverse and realistic datasets, including data that simulates real-world conditions such as noise, room responses, and over-the-air distortions, which are common in malicious contexts. Furthermore, the authors suggest that detection methods should be evaluated not only on their ability to identify deepfakes but also on their robustness against adversarial attacks, which have been shown to pose significant challenges for both image and audio-based models.
