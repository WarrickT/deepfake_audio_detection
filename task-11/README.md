# Noise Injection for Audio Samples

This Python module is designed to add background noise or distortions to audio samples, simulating real-world conditions. It is particularly useful for robust model training in machine learning applications, where adding noise can help improve the generalization and performance of models.

## Features
- Loads an audio file in `.wav` format.
- Injects white noise into the audio signal.
- Saves the noisy audio as a new `.wav` file.
- Visualizes the original and noisy audio waveforms for comparison.

## Requirements
To run this program, you need the following Python libraries installed:
- `librosa` (for audio processing and visualization)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations and noise generation)
- `soundfile` (for saving the noisy audio file)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting the audio waveforms)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install librosa numpy soundfile matplotlib

Implement noise injection to add background noise or distortions to audio samples, simulating real-world conditions for robust model training. Write a script on a test audio. Example libraries include librosa, scipy, and pydub.
