# Describe the different types of deep fake audio generations: TTS, voice conversion, emotion fake, scene fake, and partially fake, explaining their implications for detection.

## TTS (Text-to-Speech)
("detection" OR "detect") AND ("text-to-speech" OR "text to speech" OR "TTS") AND ("artificial intelligence" OR "AI")

Text-to-speech (TTS), or speech synthesis, refers to the ability to convert written text into a human-like sounding voice. With its vast assortment of applications ranging from commercial to personal use, methods of generating voice through speech synthesizers have undergone major advancements in recent years.

TTS is composed of two major steps:

1. **Text Analysis:**  
   The process of transforming a text-input string into a symbolic or phonetic representation used to build acoustic and prosodic models.

2. **Creating Speech Waveforms:**  
   This can be partitioned into two broad categories:
   - **Traditional Machine Learning-Based Techniques:**
     - Concatenative speech synthesis
     - Epoch Synchronous Non-Overlap and Add (ESNOLA)
     - Pitch Synchronous Overlap and Add (PSOLA)
     - Time Domain Pitch Synchronous Overlap and Add (TDPSOLA)
   - **Parametric Speech Synthesis:**  
     Similar to concatenative synthesis, but differs in the units saved in the database and the signal restoration procedure.
   - **Deep Machine Learning-Based Techniques**

## Voice Conversion
While TTS focuses on converting text to voice, **Voice Conversion (VC)** modifies the speaker’s voice to sound as if it was produced by a targeted speaker. The search for effective manipulation of speech first debuted in the 1950s. Through rapid development in speech processing in the 1970s and recent technological advancements (including deep learning), VC has made a significant impact on daily applications such as communication aids for the speech impaired or commercial applications like dubbing for the video entertainment industry.

Speakers are generalized into three categories: linguistic factors, supra-segmental factors, and segmental factors that are related to short-term features. Effective VC aims to convert the segmental and supra-segmental factors.

VC consists of three main steps:
1. **Speech Analysis:**  
   Deconstructs speech signals in a way that manipulations can be done to the acoustic properties of the speech. Techniques are often categorized into model-based and signal-based techniques.
2. **Mapping:**  
   Transforms the analyzed speech signals to match the target speaker’s characteristics.
3. **Reconstruction:**  
   Converts the modified speech signals back to an audible form.

Commonly used models for speech analysis and reconstruction include:
- **Signal-Based Representations:**
  - Pitch Synchronous OverLap and Add (PSOLA)
  - Harmonic plus Noise Model (HNM)
- **Model-Based Representations:**
  - Speech Transformation and Representation using Adaptive Interpolation of the weiGHTed spectrum (STRAIGHT)
  - WaveNet Vocoder (a deep learning approach that requires a large amount of data, providing a data-driven solution)

## Emotion Fake

**Emotion Fake**, often referred to as **Emotion Voice Conversion (EVC)**, is a special type of VC that focuses on changing the speaker’s source emotion to a targeted emotion.

Commonly used frameworks include:
- Variational Autoencoding Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (VAW-GAN)
- Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)
- Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN)
- Star Generative Adversarial Network (StarGAN)

## Scene Fake

While other types of deep fake audio focus on the conversion of the main voice/speech, **Scene Fake** focuses on the environmental context of the audio. It can include adding background noise characteristics or applying different acoustic settings to match the conditions of a distinct location. The main objective of scene fake is to change the location setting that the listener perceives—for example, adding noise to make it sound like the speaker is in a busy train station. Alternatively, it can involve removing noise signals to estimate clean speech from a noisy audio.

## Partially Fake

**Partially Fake** is a type of audio manipulation that targets specific parts of speech instead of the entire audio. It involves inserting certain words or phrases within a sentence using artificially generated audio segments while retaining the original speaker’s vocal qualities. This type of conversion is especially hard to recognize because it keeps the overall sound and tone of the speaker’s voice and only adds small fragments that can easily be overlooked. Partial fakes are used in situations where only particular segments of speech need to be altered to change the meaning or outcome of the audio recording.
