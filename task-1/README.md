# Task 1: Document the workings of a simple transformer, focusing on keys, queries, values, self-attention, and feed-forward layers, explaining their roles in processing sequential data for deepfake audio detection.

## Transformer Model Overview

The Transformer model is a neural network architecture designed for processing sequential data. It relies on self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between different parts of the input sequence, making it highly effective for tasks like text generation, translation, and audio processing.

## Key Components

1. **Keys, Queries, and Values**:
   - **Queries (Q)**: Represent the current token or element for which we are computing attention.
   - **Keys (K)**: Represent all tokens or elements in the sequence.
   - **Values (V)**: Represent the actual values or embeddings associated with the keys.

2. **Self-Attention**:
   - Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in the sequence when processing each token.
   - The attention score is computed as the dot product of the query and key, followed by a softmax operation to obtain attention weights.
   - The output is a weighted sum of the values, where the weights are the attention scores.

3. **Feed-Forward Layers**:
   - These are fully connected layers applied to the output of the self-attention mechanism.
   - They introduce non-linearity and help in learning complex patterns in the data.

## Processing Sequential Data for Deep Fake Audio Detection

For deepfake audio detection, the input data could be a three-dimensional tensor with the shape `(batch_size, feature_1, feature_2)`. `feature_1` and `feature_2` could represent:

- **feature_1**: the time steps or frames in the audio sequence.
- **feature_2**: the features extracted from each time step, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectrogram values, or other audio features.

## Example Workflow

1. **Input Representation**:
   - The input tensor has the shape `(batch_size, time_steps, features)`.
   - Each element in the batch is a sequence of audio frames, with each frame represented by a set of features.

2. **Embedding**:
   - The input features are projected into a higher-dimensional space using an embedding layer.

3. **Self-Attention Mechanism**:
   - For each time step, queries, keys, and values are computed.
   - Attention scores are calculated to determine the importance of each time step relative to others.
   - The output is a weighted sum of the values, capturing the dependencies between different time steps.

4. **Feed-Forward Layers**:
   - The output of the self-attention mechanism is passed through feed-forward layers to learn complex patterns.
   - Dropout and layer normalization are applied to improve generalization and stability.

5. **Output**:
   - The final output can be used for classification tasks, such as detecting whether the audio is real or fake.
