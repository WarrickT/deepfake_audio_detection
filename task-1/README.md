# Task 1: Document the workings of a simple transformer, focusing on keys, queries, values, self-attention, and feed-forward layers, explaining their roles in processing sequential data for deep fake audio detection (I will ask you to look at a sample file). Hint, assume input is a three dimensional input (batch_size, feature_1, feature_2). What could feature_1, and feature_2 be?
