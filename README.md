# Building and Attacking Audio Deepfake Detectors

## Overview
This repository focuses on developing and evaluating machine learning models for detecting AI-generated audio (deepfake audio). The project involves both implementing a trustworthy detection system and exploring adversarial attacks to improve robustness. 

## Motivation
With the rise of deepfake technologies, AI-generated audio poses threats including misinformation, fraud, privacy violations, and security risks. The goal of this project is to investigate whether we can build a reliable AI model to detect and analyze AI-generated audio, thereby maintaining trust in digital media.

## Objectives
1. **Develop a Trustworthy Audio Deepfake Detector**  
   - Implement an application that takes an audio input and determines whether it is AI-generated.
2. **Adversarial Analysis and Defense**  
   - Research adversarial attacks on audio deepfake detectors and improve model robustness accordingly.
3. **Summarize Findings**  
   - Maintain documentation, research insights, and implementation details in this repository.

## Project Structure
This repository includes:
- **Literature Review**: Summaries of key research papers.
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Methods for obtaining and preparing datasets.
- **Model Development**: Implementing architectures for deepfake detection.
- **Adversarial Attacks & Defenses**: Experiments to improve model robustness.
- **Results & Analysis**: Performance evaluations and visualizations.

## Requirements & Evaluation Criteria
### 1. Quantitative Performance
- Utilize appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC).
- Justify the choice of metrics and interpret what they reveal about the model.

### 2. Credibility
- Use credible sources for literature review.
- Follow a standardized citation format (e.g., IEEE).

### 3. Theory
- Design a robust architecture considering adversarial threats.
- Demonstrate and verify model effectiveness.

### 4. Presentation
